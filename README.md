# Alert Manager
![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/ttldtor/alert_manager.svg?branch=develop "Build Status")

- **Authors**:		Simon Balz <simon@balz.me>, Mika Borner <mika.borner@gmail.com>
- **Description**:	Extended Splunk Alert Manager with advanced reporting on alerts, workflows (modify assignee, status, severity) and auto-resolve features
- **Version**: 		@version@

## Introduction
The Alert Manager adds simple incident workflows to Splunk. The general purpose is to provide a common app with dashboards in order to investigate fired alerts or notable events. It can be used with every Splunk alert and works as an extension on top of Splunk's built-in alerting mechanism.

- Awareness of your current operational situation with the incident posture dashboard
- Analyze root cause of incidents with only a few clicks
- Review and adjust the urgency of incidents to improve operations scheduling
- Dispatch incidents to the person in charge
- Track and report incident workflow KPIs
- Tag and categorize incidents

## Features
- Works as Custom Alert Action to catch enriched metadata of fired alerts and stores them in a configurable separate index
- Each fired alert creates an incident
- Configured incidents to run well-known scripted alert scripts
- Reassign incidents manually or auto-assign them to specific users
- Change incidents to another priority and status
- Incidents can be configured to get auto-resolved when a new incident is created from the same alert
- Incidents can be configured to get auto-resolved when the alert's ttl is reached
